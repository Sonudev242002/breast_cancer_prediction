## Overview

This repository focuses on predicting breast cancer using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop models that accurately classify tumors as benign or malignant.

## Methodologies and Techniques

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Normalizing data to improve model accuracy.

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Using statistical methods to identify significant features, reducing dimensionality.

3. **Machine Learning Models**
   - **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification.
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Implemented with various kernels for non-linear relationships.
   - **Random Forest**: Robust against complex feature interactions.
   - **Neural Networks**: To capture complex patterns through deep learning.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
   - Cross-validation to ensure generalizability.

5. **Visualization**
   - Data distributions, feature importance, and model performance.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.

## Conclusion

This project provides a robust approach to breast cancer prediction, aiding in early detection and treatment planning.
